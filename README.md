## 📖 **What is Realm?**

Realm is an adaptation of *Reigns*—a critically acclaimed card-based decision-making game. In this version, you take the role of a monarch who must make decisions by swiping left or right. Each decision affects different aspects of your kingdom, such as:

- 💰 **Economy**: Keep the kingdom wealthy or risk bankruptcy.
- ⚔️ **Military**: Maintain the strength of your army to defend against threats.
- 👑 **Popularity**: Keep the people happy to avoid uprisings.
- 🏰 **Royal Power**: Ensure your own authority remains intact!

> “Decisions are easy, but ruling is hard.”
